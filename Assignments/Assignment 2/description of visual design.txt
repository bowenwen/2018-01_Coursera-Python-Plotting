I have encoded warm color with high temperatures and cold color with low temperatures. I have also removed redundant axis labels and utilized light and clean horizontal dash lines to indicate extreme temperature ranges. The area between the high and low temperatures are shaded with a subtle yet effective light grey. The resulting chart is both easy to interpret (functional), scientifical accurate (truthful), and aesthetically pleasing (beautiful). My hope is that such figure can elicit insightful discussion around seasonal tempereature variations and record temperatures.

The area between the high and low temperatures are shaded with a subtle light grey. The x axis is labelled at the month to help the reader navigate seasonal temperature variations. The resulting chart is both easy to interpret (functional), scientifical accurate (truthful), and aesthetically pleasing (beautiful).
